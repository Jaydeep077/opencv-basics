# OpenCV Basics

A simple repository to get started with OpenCV in Python. This project demonstrates basic operations like displaying images, playing videos, and accessing the webcam.

## Installation

Make sure Python is installed, then install OpenCV:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
## How to Run

## Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaydeep077/opencv-basics.git
cd opencv-basics
```

Run any Python file:
```bash
python show_image.py
python show_video.py
python webcam_basic.py
```

## Or run using main.py:
Uncomment the module you want to run in ```bash main.py ```, then run python ```bash main.py```.

e.g main.py
```bash
# import show_image
# import show_video
import draw_shape   # ← runs this example

python main.py
```
## Notes
Press d to close video or webcam windows

Ensure image and video files are placed in the correct folders before running the scripts
